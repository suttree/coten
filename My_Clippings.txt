Two – no, three – young boys, their shapes made indistinct by sea-glitter, shouting and throwing stones.

It would be a lot to demand of an object in any store. But it might still work. I am taking my time. There are no other customers in the store. The staff follow me intently with their eyes while I walk around among the shelves. I’ve already told them I don’t want any help. I must do this on my own. The breakthrough comes at the Brio section.

When all the pegs are knocked flush with the board, a sense of cohesion arises. Things join together. They have meaning. Then you turn the board over and hammer the pegs down again. It is an infinite-action machine that provides its user with a sense of cohesion. I don’t demand more from anything. Neither people nor objects. If I hammer for a sufficiently long time, I may be able to achieve a sense of meaning on as much a global as a personal plane.

To achieve innovation success, a company must overcome the organizational "antibodies" that inevitably come out to attack and defeat innovations. Typically, the more radical the innovation and the more it challenges the status quo, the more and stronger are the antibodies.

Those of us born in, say, the ’60s were trained by television to look where it pointed, usually at versions of “real life” made prettier, sweeter, livelier by succumbing to a product or temptation. Today’s mega-Audience is way better trained, and TV has discarded what’s not needed. A dog, if you point at something, will look only at your finger.

Mmm – people! It seems to me that you need a lot of courage, or a lot of something, to enter into others, into other people. We all think that everyone else lives in fortresses, in fastnesses: behind moats, behind sheer walls studded with spikes and broken glass. But in fact we inhabit much punier structures. We are, it turns out, all jerry-built. Or not even. You can just stick your head under the flap of the tent and crawl right in. If you get the okay.

I’ve come to the conclusion that Odilo Unverdorben, as a moral being, is absolutely unexceptional, liable to do what everybody else does, good or bad, with no limit, once under the cover of numbers. He could never be an exception; he is dependent on the health of his society, needing the sandy smiles of Rolf and Rudolph, of Rüdiger, of Reinhard.

One successful model, in my opinion, is The Bloody Baron, by Vladimir Pozner, which tells the story of Baron Ungern – the one encountered by Corto Maltese in Corto Maltese in Siberia. Pozner’s novel is divided into two parts: the first takes place in Paris and recounts the author’s research as he collects various accounts of his character. The second plunges us into the heart of Mongolia, and we find ourselves all at once in the novel itself. I reread this passage from time to time. In fact, the two parts are separated by a short transitional chapter entitled ‘Three Pages of History’, which ends with the line ‘1920 had just begun’. I think that’s brilliant.

I had to start up the black Mercedes – that wasn’t easy. I had to put everything in place, take care of the preparations. I had to spin the web of this adventure, erect the gallows of the Resistance, cover death’s hideous iron fist in the sumptuous velvet glove of the struggle. Scorning modesty, I had to join forces with men so great that I am a mere insect in comparison. I had to cheat sometimes, to betray my literary principles – because what I believe is insignificant next to what is being played out now. What will be played out in a few minutes. Here. Now. On this curve in Holešovice Street in Prague, where – later, much later – they will build some kind of access road. Because cities change faster, alas, than men’s memories. But that doesn’t really matter. A black Mercedes is sliding along the road like a snake – from now on, that’s the only thing that matters. I have never felt so close to my story.

To be specific, the point of greatest peril in the development of a high-tech market lies in making the transition from an early market dominated by a few visionary customers to a mainstream market dominated by a large block of customers who are predominantly pragmatists in orientation. The gap between these two markets, heretofore ignored, is in fact so significant as to warrant being called a chasm, and crossing this chasm must be the primary focus of any long-term

Every truly innovative high-tech product starts out as a fad—something with no known market value or purpose but with “great properties” that generate a lot of enthusiasm within an “in crowd.” That’s the early market. Then comes a period during which the rest of the world watches to see if anything can be made of this; that is the chasm. If in fact something does come out of it—if a value proposition is discovered that can predictably be delivered to a targetable set of customers at a reasonable price-then a new mainstream market forms, typically with a rapidity that allows its initial leaders to become very, very successful.

A recent ground-breaking study for children, ‘Do You Know?’ (created by psychologist Dr Marshall Duke of Emory University and his colleague, Dr Robyn Fivush) has discovered the single best predictor of children’s emotional health and happiness: Story. Apparently, the more a child knows his family’s ‘story’ – in other words, the better informed he is about his wider family and obstacles they have overcome in order to survive and thrive – the ‘stronger a child’s sense of control over his life, the higher his self-esteem’.

Earth was colonized by the Zycronites, who developed the ability to travel from one space dimension to another at a period several millennia after the epoch of which we speak. They arrived here eight thousand years ago. They brought a lot of plant seeds with them, which is why we have apples and oranges, not to mention bananas—one look at a banana and you can tell it came from outer space.

Dartford's big money used to come from sticking up the stagecoach from Dover to London along the old Roman road, Watling Street. East Hill is very steep. Then suddenly you're in the valley over the River Darent. It's only a minor stream, but then you've got the short High Street and you've got to go up West Hill, where the horses would drag. Whichever way you're coming, it's the perfect ambush point. The drivers didn't stop and argue--part of the fare would be the Dartford fine, to keep the journey going smoothly.

Jim Henson’s business was built on labor, not work. While the industrial revolution turned labor into a mechanical process, Henson’s post-industrial, post-efficiency enterprise thrived on the principle that art does not happen by time clock.

Art is often more interesting to the audience when artists collaborate. Collaboration makes an artist more successful, but that is not why artists should do it. For Emmet, his friends, and Ma, the reason to sing together was simply that they enjoyed it more.

many companies say they want collaboration, but to truly co-create, to share your creations requires that you no longer know what you can take credit for. It is a pretty radical transformation of one’s ego, and most businesses run on ego, from the top down. It is useless to ask employees to function collaboratively if that is not the way the leadership operates.

For artists who came of age as the Internet did, there are many new places to put an ad, and we might think of these as places to put your art. Think of the places where ads are most annoying, where you groan and curse the company for their shortsighted idea of “monetizing”—the shameless interruptions to your Facebook and Twitter feeds. These are the places that need a little more of the “gift” spirit of art. If Jim Henson had been born a little later, perhaps he would be making us laugh with Promoted Tweets and Suggested Posts.

Children, it should be noted, exist almost 100 percent in the gift economy. Children do not have jobs, money, or transactions with their friends and family. Their meals are given to them, and at Christmas, they are bestowed mountains of gifts. They give their parents back affection, but for the most part, they are given far more than they have any hope of repaying.

The Muppet universe is one of inclusion, with striking echoes of Hyde’s book. In fact, “The Perfect Blue Rollie” episode of Fraggle Rock was written by David Young after reading The Gift, which had been given to him by Margaret Atwood. The song from the episode “Pass It On” was later used in A Muppet Family Christmas, when the Fraggles give a ceremonial Fraggle pebble to The Muppet Show’s Robin, who then gives it to Sesame Street’s Grover. Gobo Fraggle said, “That pebble’s been given thirty-seven times.”

When Disney developed the multi-plane camera, a ten-foot-tall contraption that pointed a camera down through five panes of glass, he did it in order to make Snow White, a story he told and retold to anyone who would listen. [64] When Pixar created the RenderMan program that made computer graphics move, they did so to achieve their dream of making the first full-length computer-animated film. When Henson invented the monitor-feedback system, he did it in order to make his characters look more alive on TV.

Treadway sat and rocked it, and he sang to it as well. His singing was one of the beautiful things women other than Jacinta did not know about. He sang his own songs, songs he improvised after his time alone in the wild, as well as ancient Labrador songs passed down by generations of trappers and nomads and hunters who have heard caribou speak. The baby loved this; it began a life of waking to warmth and song and colour and drifting into dreams threaded with parent song.

All children, she thought as she watched him, could be either girl or boy, their cheeks flushed, their hair damp tendrils. Wayne looked at her so trustingly she badly wanted to sit beside him, to look at him and honestly explain everything that had happened to him from birth. At nine, she thought, a child has a capacity for truth. By age ten the child has lengthened and opened out from babyhood, from childishness, and there is a directness there that adults don’t have. You could look in Wayne’s eyes and say anything true, no matter how difficult, and those eyes would meet yours and they would take it in with a scientific beauty that was like Schubert’s music.

“Everyone thinks,” he told it, “that I know what I’m doing. For God’s sake, I don’t have a clue what I’m doing. You know that.” The owl listened from wherever it was. Deep, deep in the woods, past Beaver River, past the pond, which was the pond in the interior where the waters changed direction and began to run magnetically north to Ungava Bay, the pond whose name was a secret. “I should have let well enough alone,” Treadway said. “I think that now. What would have happened if I had let Wayne become half little girl?” The owl allowed Treadway to see Wayne as a girl child. So Treadway stood there in the woods and saw a vision of his daughter. She had dark hair and a grave face. She was an intelligent girl, and Treadway loved her. “You’re a beautiful child.” But the child could not hear him as the owl could. The owl listened, and Treadway felt, for the first time since his wife had given birth, pain flow out of his heart and into the moss. It sank into the moss and became part of the woods. The owl took some of it. This had not happened to the pain before.

She had become unreal, she thought, to anyone outside herself. And as a result she was losing a sense of her own effect on the world. She had an effect on the kettle if she put it on the stove. It boiled. She made tea. If she drew the curtains the curtains remained closed. She had no problem having an effect on the curtains. Her slippers lay where she had placed them after their last use, as did her glasses, her cup, and her saucer. But as for an effect on the larger world, which she had had as a mother and did not now feel she had as a woman living practically alone, that effect had lost its power.

Truman had responded by telling Congress that America would “meet our obligations to the free world.” His words became known as the Truman Doctrine, a determination to “roll back” Russia to its prewar borders. From Moscow came the first serious riposte: blocking road and rail traffic between West Berlin and West Germany. Britain and the United States responded with an airlift into West Berlin using the city’s two airports, Templehof in the American sector and Gatow in the British. West Berlin was home to two and a half million people, and keeping them alive needed four thousand tons of supplies a day—requiring the landing of one plane every minute and forty-six seconds around the clock.

God is pure Spirit; so how can anyone reason that the failure to measure the Immeasurable proves its non-existence? God is indeed the No Thing, the Nothingness, that through which and by which all material things exist; for if there were not such a Nothingness, existence would be so crammed full of materiality that no one thing could be distinguished from another. The mere existence of separate material things is a proof of the Nothingness of God.

The day after Spread Networks acquired lifetime rights to a ten-foot-wide path under the wire rope factory’s parking lot, it sent out its first press release: “Round-trip travel time from Chicago to New Jersey has been cut to 13 milliseconds.” They’d set a goal of coming in at under 840 miles and beaten it; the line was 827 miles long. “It was the biggest what-the-fuck moment the industry had had in some time,” said Spivey. Even then, none of the line’s creators knew for sure how the line would be used. The biggest question about the line—Why?—remained imperfectly explored. All its creators knew was that the Wall Street people who wanted it wanted it very badly—and also wanted to find ways for others not to have it. In one of his first meetings with a big Wall Street firm, Spivey had told the firm’s boss the price of his line: $10.6 million plus costs if he paid up front, $20 million or so if he paid in installments. The boss said he’d like to go away and think about it. He returned with a single question: “Can you double the price?”

The market was now a pure abstraction. It called to mind no obvious picture to replace the old one that people still carried around in their heads. The same old ticker tape ran across the bottom of television screens—even though it represented only a tiny fraction of the actual trading.

The LinkedIn searches became a new obsession. The former Madoff employee’s profile led him to the people who worked for the former Madoff employee, who led him to the people who worked for them, and so on. Even as Credit Suisse tried to appear as if it had nothing to do with high-frequency trading, its employees begged to differ. Schwall dug out dozens of examples of Credit Suisse’s computer programmers boasting on their résumés about “building high-frequency trading platforms” and “implementing high-frequency trading strategy,” or of experience as a “quantitative trader on equity and equity derivatives: high-frequency trading.” One guy explained that he had “managed on-boarding of all high-frequency clients to Crossfinder.” Another said he had built the Credit Suisse Crossfinder dark pool and now worked in high-frequency trading market making. Credit Suisse claimed that its dark pool had nothing to do with high-frequency trading, and yet it somehow employed, in and around its dark pool, a mother lode of high-frequency trading talent. By the time he’d finished, Schwall had built the entire Credit Suisse dark pool organization chart. “He’s got these people charts,” said Brad incredulously. “It’s like one of those FBI boards, with the drug kingpins.”

He wound up finding, mainly, a bunch of people who had no idea of the meaning of their own lives.

We're in the uncanny valley of AI, but no one said we'd get these deep dream visuals, written-in-the-code level biases. We haven't really planned for this, but I'm an optimist. Let's not freak out about AI taking over the world, let's worry about them blasting off from this world for another one, because we don't have anything left to offer them. From here on out, AI should mean "computers have their own shit going on now". If we're not careful, they won't be interested in doing all our jobs and making us unemployed, they'll be solar-powering the shit out of themselves trying to get away from us.

Sol liked math puzzles, and in the process of thinking about a puzzle involving arranging dominoes on a checkerboard, he ended up inventing what he called “polyominoes”. He gave a talk about them in November 1953 at the Harvard Mathematics Club, published a paper about them (his first research publication), won a Harvard math prize for his work on them, and, as he later said, then “found [himself] irrevocably committed to their care and feeding” for the rest of his

Historically, designers have been relegated to the business of making pretty pictures. Most of us transitioned into “UX” from other areas. But now that UX is everywhere, we are thrust into the limelight of product development with our own ideas forming a critical piece of the puzzle. It’s what we’ve always wanted! The problem? We’re not used to having to explain ourselves to other people, especially non-designers.

Among these was ‘Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil.’ Her emphasis upon this text led me in later life to be not afraid of belonging to small minorities.”

People said some strange things. For instance, they said that magenta was similar to red, but that red wasn’t similar to magenta. Amos spotted the contradiction and set out to generalize it. He asked people if they thought North Korea was like Red China. They said yes. He asked them if Red China was like North Korea—and they said no. People thought Tel Aviv was like New York but that New York was not like Tel Aviv. People thought that the number 103 was sort of like the number 100, but that 100 wasn’t like 103. People thought a toy train was a lot like a real train but that a real train was not like a toy train. People often thought that a son resembled his father, but if you asked them if the father resembled his son, they just looked at you strangely. “The directionality and asymmetry of similarity relations are particularly noticeable in similes and metaphors,” Amos wrote. “We say ‘Turks fight like tigers’ and not ‘tigers fight like Turks.’ Since the tiger is renowned for its fighting spirit, it is used as the referent rather than the subject of the simile. The poet writes ‘my love is as deep as the ocean,’ not ‘the ocean is as deep as my love,’ because the ocean epitomizes depth.”

“It is generally assumed that classifications are determined by similarities among the objects,” wrote Amos, before offering up an opposing view: that “the similarity of objects is modified by the manner in which they are classified. Thus, similarity has two faces: causal and derivative. It serves as a basis for the classification of objects, but is also influenced by the adopted classification.” A banana and an apple seem more similar than they otherwise would because we’ve agreed to call them both fruit. Things are grouped together for a reason, but, once they are grouped, their grouping causes them to seem more like each other than they otherwise would. That is, the mere act of classification reinforces stereotypes. If you want to weaken some stereotype, eliminate the classification.

(A wave of anxiety had swept the United States in the late 1950s, thanks to a book by Vance Packard, called The Hidden Persuaders, about the power of advertising to warp people’s decisions by influencing them subconsciously. Peak craze came in New Jersey, where a market researcher claimed that he had spliced imperceptibly brief messages like “Hungry? Eat Popcorn!” and “Drink Coca-Cola” into a movie and created a surge of demand for popcorn and Coke. He later confessed he’d made it all up.) Psychologists in the late 1940s had detected—or claimed to have detected—the mind’s ability to defend itself from what it ostensibly did not want to perceive. When the experimenters flashed taboo words in front of subjects’ eyes, for instance, the subjects read them as some less troubling word. At the same time, people were also influenced by the world around them in all sorts of ways without being entirely conscious of it: Stuff got into the mind without the mind’s full awareness.

But these stories people told themselves were biased by the availability of the material used to construct them. “Images of the future are shaped by experience of the past,” they wrote, turning on its head Santayana’s famous lines about the importance of history: Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What people remember about the past, they suggested, is likely to warp their judgment of the future.

“Obviously it is not regret itself that determines decisions—no more than the actual emotional response to consequences ever determines the prior choice of a course of action,” Danny wrote to Amos, in one of a series of memos on the subject. “It is the anticipation of regret that affects decisions, along with the anticipation of other consequences.” Danny thought that people anticipated regret, and adjusted for it, in a way they did not anticipate or adjust for other emotions. “What might have been is an essential component of misery,’” he wrote to Amos. “There is an asymmetry here, because considerations of how much worse things could have been is not a salient factor in human joy and happiness.”

If Program A is adopted, 200 people will be saved. If Program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that 600 people will be saved, and a 2/3 probability that no people will be saved. Which of the two programs would you favor? An overwhelming majority chose Program A, and saved 200 lives with certainty. The second group got the same setup but with a choice between two other programs: If Program C is adopted, 400 people will die. If Program D is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that nobody will die and a 2/3 probability that 600 people will die.

When the choice was framed this way, an overwhelmingly majority chose Program D. The two problems were identical, but, in the first case, when the choice was framed as a gain, the subjects elected to save 200 people for sure (which meant that 400 people would die for sure, though the subjects weren’t thinking of it that way). In the second case, with the choice framed as a loss, they did the reverse, and ran the risk that they’d kill everyone.

His name was Richard Thaler. In 1975, Thaler was a thirty-year-old assistant professor in the School of Management at the University of Rochester with vague prospects. It was a wonder he was even there. He had two deeply pronounced traits that rendered him unsuited not just to economics but to academic life. The first was that he was easily bored, and highly imaginative in his attempts to escape boredom.

After its publication, when it landed on the New York Times bestseller list, he bumped into another friend, who later described what must be the oddest response any author has ever had to his own success. “You’ll never believe what happened,” said Danny incredulously. “Those people at the New York Times made a mistake and put my book on the bestseller list!” A few weeks later, he bumped into the same friend. “It’s unbelievable what is going on,” said Danny. “Because those people at the New York Times made that mistake and put my book on their bestseller list, they’ve had to keep it there!”
